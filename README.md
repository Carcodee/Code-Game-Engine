# OpenglCarlos
 
Simple 3d game engine where I implement some off the basic concepts of opengl and graphic rendering
The main features are:

- Async model loading.
- HDR.
- Bloom.
- Shadows.
- Imgui implementation.
- instantiating objects.
- G-Frame buffer to render the light (not used in order to test other light techniques).

Issues:

-Only supported for visual studio, there is not premake or cmake implemented.

-Some lib files are not downloaded with the project (GLEW lib files).
