# OpenglCarlos
 
Simple 3d game engine where I implement some off the basic concepts of opengl and graphic rendering
The main features are:

- Async model loading.
- HDR
- Bloom
- Shadows
- Imgui implementation
- instantiating objects
- G-Frame buffer to render the light (not used in order to test other light techniques)
