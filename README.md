# OpenglCarlos
 
Simple 3d game engine where I implement some off the basic concepts of opengl and graphic rendering
The main features are:

- Async model loading.
- HDR
- Bloom
- Shadows
- Imgui implementation
- instantiating objects
- G-Frame buffer to render the light (not used in order to test other light techniques)

Issues:
-Only supported for visual study, there is not premake or cmake implemented
-Some lib files are not downloaded with the project (GLEW lib files)
